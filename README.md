## Description
* An online platform for instructors to publish short courses and students to find and subscribe to those interactive learning courses.
* It is built to promote an agile way of learning where the goal should be to create a learning story/course to teach students a specific topic in a short time frame like 2-4 weeks.
* Instructors can sign up to publish short courses/stories for students and track those courses/stories as well. Students can browse published stories/courses and subscribe to any of those courses focusing on specific topics, where they really need assistance. 
* It is built using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node) and styled using Material-UI.
* Find the application live on Heroku [here](https://agile-learning.herokuapp.com/).
